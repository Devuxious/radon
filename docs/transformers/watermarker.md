# Watermarker
*a.k.a. fingerprinting*

## Overview
Watermarking is a method of [fingerprinting](https://securitytrails.com/blog/cybersecurity-fingerprinting) the program
in some way to uniquely identify it to a particular user, corporation, server, etc. Watermarking is also sometimes
considered legal evidence in a court setting; however, you should research the specifics for that by yourself. A few
obfuscators have this feature (notably Stringer Enterprise and Allatori).

Effective automatic watermarking is often extremely difficult to do because one must ensure that 1. the watermark cannot
be removed easily by means of obfuscation, deobfuscation, or optimization; and 2. the watermark cannot be easily found
while still being easily recoverable. However, when done well, watermarking is a great way of tracking down
redistribution.
