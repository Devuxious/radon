# Number Obfuscation
*a.k.a. numerical constant scrambling*

## Overview
Number obfuscation is the process of performing some type of transformation upon numerical constants in the bytecode to
prevent attackers from easily understanding the final constant. Not many Java bytecode obfuscators offer this feature as
its effectiveness is often minimal for the overhead it often comes with.
